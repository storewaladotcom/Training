    "Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmportilla)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this training course in conjunction with NetCom Learning we will be covering the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python Refresher\n",
    "* NumPy - Linear Algebra Library\n",
    "* Matplotlib - Plotting Library\n",
    "* Pandas - Data Analysis Library\n",
    "* Sci-Kit Learn - Machine Learning Library\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll have exercises along the way and the course will be very interactive! Let's go ahead and see the planned schedule for the 3 days!"
