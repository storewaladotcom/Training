    "# Moneyball\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal for this assignment is to build a moneyball calculator for the Oakland A's head coach Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt in the movie).   This calculator/software will find the data driven best players for the least amount of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time permitting, we will re-appropiate this calculator to create data driven charts that illustrate why we made our decisions. As if we needed the ammo to bring to the big board meeting with the owner of the baseball team to convince them to make data-driven changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound a bit complex and/or difficult...but you'll be surprised just how easy it will be!!!\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "To do this assignment, you will have to know Python's Pandas.  You *could* say this assignment is just a trick to teach you the wonders of Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools and all the data to build this calculator are freely available.  What is difficult is getting the data into the format you want it.  What is complex is putting it all together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to feature engineer our 'moneyball' statistics.  These statistics are built from the standard, existing baseball statistics that Billy Beane believes will lead to earning more runs, and thus, winning more games.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Digging into hitting stats with the Batting.csv\n",
    "** Inside the data folders is a text file named `readme2013.txt`, this is the documenation for the data files. **\n",
    "\n",
    "The Batting.csv file contains what are known as 'back of the card' stats.  These are the baseball stats that were considered important because they are on the back of every single baseball card.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will combine, twist, and turn the old features to create new features in an attempt to find better a better link to winning games.  This practice is called feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a players batting average is calculated by taking the number of hits they have had, and divide it by the number of times they were at bat.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is great, because if we want to create a new column in our DataFrame, we can do so on the fly just like this.  \n",
    "``` df['new col'] = df['colA'] / df['colB'] ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your first job is to feature engineer three new statistics.\n",
    "The new stats you are calculating are Batting Average, OnBase Percentage, and Slugging Percentage.  \n",
    "Each stat should be added as a new column in dfBatting.  \n",
    "To get you started, I have done Batting Averge for you perfectly.  \n",
    "If you do not know *how* to calculate the new stats, use the links provided to figure out their equations.  You might need to reference the data's readme file to figure out what the abbreviations stand for.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Batting Average:**\n",
    "  ``` dfBatting['BA'] =  dfBatting['H'] / dfBatting['AB'] ```\n",
    "1.  **On Base Percentage (OBP)**: <br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage\n",
    "1.  **Slugging Percentage (SLG)** <br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "If you print dfBatting.tail() it should look like this.\n",
